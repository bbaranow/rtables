\usage{
MultiVarSplit(
  vars,
  split_label,
  varlabels = NULL,
  cfun = NULL,
  cformat = NULL,
  split_format = NULL,
  split_name = paste(vars, collapse = ":"),
  child_labels = c("default", "visible", "hidden"),
  extra_args = list(),
  indent_mod = 0L,
  cindent_mod = 0L,
  cvar = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vars}{character vector. Multiple variable names.}

\item{split_label}{string. Label string to be associated with the table generated by the split. Not to be confused with labels assigned to each child (which are based on the data and type of split during tabulation).}

\item{varlabels}{character vector. Labels for \code{vars}}

\item{cfun}{function/NULL. tabulation function for creating content rows. Must accept \code{df} as first parameter. Optionally accepts}

\item{cformat}{format spec. Format for content rows}

\item{split_format}{format spec. Format associated with this split.}

\item{split_name}{string. Name associiated with this split (for pathing, etc)}

\item{child_labels}{string. One of \code{"default"}, \code{"visible"}, \code{"hidden"}. What should the display behavior be for the  labels (ie label rows) of the children of this split. Defaults to \code{"default"} which flags the label row as visible only if the child has 0 content rows.}

\item{extra_args}{list. Extra arguments to be passed to the tabulation function. Element position in thte list corresponds to the children of this split. Named elements in the child-specific lists are ignored if they do not match a formal argument of the ttabulation function.}

\item{indent_mod}{numeric. Modifier for the default indent position for the structure created by this function(subtable, content table, or row) \emph{and all of that structure's children}. Defaults to 0, which corresponds to the unmodified default behavior.}
